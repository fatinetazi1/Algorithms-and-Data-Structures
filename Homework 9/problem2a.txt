Activity Selection Problem

	|0 |1 |2 |3 |4 |5 |6 |7 |8 |9 |T

a1	|s |  |  |  |  |f |  |  |  |  |5 

a2	|  |  |  |  |s |  |  |f |  |  |2

a3  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |s |  |f |2

Greedy algorithm solution: a1, a3
Optimal solution: a2, a3

A greedy algorithm will simply look at
the soonest finish time and select the
activity with that finish time as the
activity with the shortest duration (a1, a3).
In reality, the optimal solution would 
be the activity with the shortest distance
from the starting time to the finishing
time (a2, a3).
