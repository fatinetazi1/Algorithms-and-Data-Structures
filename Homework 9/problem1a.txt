Hash Function:
h1(k) = k mod 5
h2(k) = (7.k) 8
m = 5
h(k,i) = (h1(k) + iÂ·h2(k)) mod m

Initially, the h1(k) function is used.
In case of collision, h(k, i) function is used, 
where i increased by 1 until an empty slot is 
found.

Sequence: < 3, 10, 2, 4 >

k=3; h1(k)= 3%5 = 3; 
k=10 h1(k)= 10%5 = 0; 
k=2; h1(k)= 2%5 = 2; 
k=4; h1(k)= 4%5 = 4;
